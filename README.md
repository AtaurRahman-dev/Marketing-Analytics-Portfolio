# Marketing Analytics Portfolio Project

## Project Overview

This project presents a complete Marketing Analytics solution designed for an online retail business, "ShopEasy." The core objective was to leverage data to address critical business challenges such as declining customer engagement, reduced conversion rates, and the need to optimize marketing spend for better return on investment (ROI).

This comprehensive solution covers the entire data analytics pipeline: from raw data ingestion and transformation using SQL, to advanced analytical processing like sentiment analysis with Python, and ultimately, the delivery of interactive business insights through a dynamic Power BI dashboard.

**Key Goals of the Project:**
* To establish a robust and scalable data model tailored for marketing analysis.
* To extract actionable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and engagement patterns.
* To provide data-driven recommendations that will enhance marketing strategies and drive positive business outcomes.

## Technologies Used

* **SQL Server:** For database management, data warehousing (OLAP principles), and performing complex Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations.
* **Python (Pandas, NLTK):** For advanced data manipulation, connecting to databases, and implementing natural language processing techniques like sentiment analysis.
* **Power BI:** For developing interactive dashboards, building sophisticated data models using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), and visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Project Structure

This repository is organized to follow a logical progression through the data analytics project lifecycle:

* **`Marketing Analytics Business Case.pptx`**:
    * **Description:** This presentation outlines the initial business problem faced by "ShopEasy," defines the project's scope, sets clear objectives, and details the proposed methodology for the marketing analytics solution. It serves as the foundational document for understanding the project's context and goals.

* **`Database Setup & SQL Scripts`**:
    * **`PortfolioProject_MarketingAnalytics.bak`**:
        * **Description:** A SQL Server database backup file. Restoring this file will set up the foundational database schema and populate it with the initial raw data required for the project.
    * **`dim_customers.sql`**:
        * **Description:** SQL script for creating and populating the `dim_customers` dimension table. It enriches customer records with geographical information (Country, City) by joining with a geography table, facilitating regional analysis.
    * **`dim_products.sql`**:
        * **Description:** SQL script for creating and populating the `dim_products` dimension table. This script categorizes products based on their `Price` into 'Low', 'Medium', or 'High' categories, which is crucial for product performance segmentation.
    * **`fact_customer_reviews.sql`**:
        * **Description:** SQL script for creating and populating the `fact_customer_reviews` fact table. This script focuses on initial data cleaning, specifically addressing and standardizing whitespace issues within the `ReviewText` column, preparing it for subsequent sentiment analysis.
    * **`fact_engagement_data.sql`**:
        * **Description:** SQL script for creating and populating the `fact_engagement_data` fact table. It performs data cleaning and normalization, including extracting Views and Clicks from a combined field, standardizing `ContentType` values, and filtering out irrelevant records (e.g., 'Newsletter' content).
    * **`fact_customer_journey.sql`**:
        * **Description:** SQL script for creating and populating the `fact_customer_journey` fact table. This script is essential for cleaning and de-duplicating customer interaction data, ensuring that each unique step in the customer's journey is accurately recorded and tracked.

* **`Python Analytics & Enriched Data`**:
    * **`customer_reviews_enrichment.py`**:
        * **Description:** A Python script that performs advanced sentiment analysis on the customer review data. It connects to the SQL database (ensure connection string in the script matches your setup), downloads the NLTK VADER lexicon, calculates sentiment scores (`SentimentScore`), and categorizes reviews into 'Positive', 'Negative', 'Mixed', or 'Neutral' (`SentimentCategory`), and also buckets scores (`SentimentBucket`).
    * **`fact_customer_reviews_with_sentiment.csv`**:
        * **Description:** The output CSV file generated by the `customer_reviews_enrichment.py` script. This file contains the `fact_customer_reviews` data augmented with the calculated `SentimentScore`, `SentimentCategory`, and `SentimentBucket`, ready for integration into Power BI.

* **`Power BI Dashboard Files`**:
    * **`Marketing_Analysis.pbix`**:
        * **Description:** The main Power BI Desktop file for the project. This file contains the fully developed interactive dashboard, integrating all the transformed SQL data and the sentiment-enriched CSV. It provides visual insights into KPIs, customer trends, product performance, and customer sentiment.
    * **`Calendar DAX Script.txt`**:
        * **Description:** A text file containing the DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) script used to create a robust and flexible calendar dimension table within the Power BI data model. This ensures comprehensive time-based analysis and filtering in the dashboard.
    * **`Dashboard Screenshots/`**:
        * **Description:** This folder contains high-resolution screenshots of the Power BI dashboard, showcasing different views, key insights, and the interactive capabilities of the visualizations.

* **`Presentation.pptx`**:
    * **Description:** A presentation file demonstrating how the key insights, findings, and actionable recommendations derived from the data analysis and the Power BI dashboard can be effectively communicated to stakeholders.

## Key Insights & Actionable Recommendations

Through the meticulous data analysis and visualization, this project delivers several crucial insights and actionable recommendations for "ShopEasy," including:
* Identifying specific marketing channels and product categories that drive the highest engagement and conversion rates.
* Gaining a deep understanding of customer sentiment from reviews and its impact on product satisfaction.
* Pinpointing critical stages in the customer journey where interventions can improve conversion funnels.
* Strategies for optimizing marketing budget allocation and content creation based on performance metrics.
* Approaches to address negative customer feedback and improve overall customer satisfaction to foster loyalty and positive word-of-mouth.

## How to Set Up and Run (Local Environment)

To set up and explore this project on your local machine:

1.  **SQL Server Setup:**
    * Restore the `PortfolioProject_MarketingAnalytics.bak` file to your SQL Server instance to create the database.
    * Execute the SQL scripts (`dim_customers.sql`, `dim_products.sql`, `fact_customer_reviews.sql`, `fact_engagement_data.sql`, `fact_customer_journey.sql`) in sequence to build and populate the dimension and fact tables.

2.  **Python Environment:**
    * Ensure you have Python installed.
    * Install necessary libraries: `pip install pandas pyodbc nltk sqlalchemy`.
    * Run `customer_reviews_enrichment.py`. This script will connect to your SQL Server database (ensure connection string in the script matches your setup), perform sentiment analysis, and generate `fact_customer_reviews_with_sentiment.csv`.

3.  **Power BI Dashboard:**
    * Open `Marketing_Analysis.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
    * You might need to refresh the data sources and ensure they correctly point to your local SQL Server instance and the generated `fact_customer_reviews_with_sentiment.csv` file.
    * The `Calendar DAX Script.txt` can be used to recreate or verify the calendar table in Power BI's data model if needed.

## Future Enhancements

* Integration of real-time streaming data for immediate insights into marketing campaign performance.
* Implementation of predictive models for customer churn forecasting or sales prediction.
* Deep dive into customer segmentation based on behavior and demographics.
* Development of more advanced A/B testing analysis directly within the dashboard.
